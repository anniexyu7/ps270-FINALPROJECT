## Introduction 

Mass incarceration and high recidivism rates have defined the American criminal justice system for decades. Expedited by the War on Drugs and perpetuated by the policies and stigmas surrounding incarcerated individuals post-release, it is pertinent to public health that the underlying mechanisms driving such a concern is better understood. Surprisingly, there is a lack of longitudinal research that specifically isolates the relationship between the presence of substance use and the likelihood of recidivism.

Because co-occurring disorders are common, it is difficult to isolate a control group of inmates who have never struggled with substance use and are honest about it. It is even harder to follow this sample across an extended period of time to determine if they re-offended or if they have introduced drugs into their lifestyles. This report seeks to answer the question: how does recidivism vary among those who experience substance use? Further, how does one's original offense affect their likelihood of recidivism? I take a different route in examining the relationship between substance use and recidivism by focusing on specific crime categories—violent, property, drug, and public order offenses—then analyzing how substance use trends within these categories relate to recidivism. 

[explain why these options, not white-collar, organized, or victimless crimes] 

My hypothesis assumes that substance use is an underlying mechanism that influences what crime an individual is likely to commit and therefore how likely recidivism is for them. I come to this conclusion by taking into the lifelong ramifications that substance use has on an individual and its interconnected character that affects all aspects of an individual: physical health, mental health, socioeconomic tendancies, behavior, and cognition. Therefore, I predict that those who struggle with substance use are more likely to commit crimes that are likely to be re-offended, resulting in higher rearrest, reincarceration, and reconviction rates of individuals with problematic substance use. 

The primary explanatory variable is the presence of substance use in an individual's life. This can be measured during the screening and assessment process of intake for correctional facilities, drug testing, self-reported surveys, and medical records. These records alone will show variation among the sample, because those incarcerated now or in the past have different histories with substance use along with varying levels of severity when it comes to disorders. This approach must be longitudinal, because we must see changes or lack of changes in substance use over the span of their life before and during incarceration, along with the three years following their release. That way, we can see at what points in time substance use was at its peak in relation to their criminal behavior. 

The outcome variable of interest is the rate of recidivism for each individual. This is typically measured by the number of re-arrests, re-convictions, and re-incarcerations that occur within three years of being released from jail/prison, including those released on extended supervision/parole. This data is typically public information. 

One observed pattern in the data that would provide support for my hypothesis is higher recidivism rates among those struggling with one or more substance use disorders. 

An observed pattern that would disprove my hypothesis is higher recidivism rates among those without the presence of substance use or those with relatively low levels of substance use. This would mean that substance use is not a causal indicator of high recidivism and that there is a confounding variable that has a larger effect on the likelihood that an individual will re-offend. For instance, mental illness, employment, environment, housing, education, etc.

## The Data 

The first set of data comes from the New Survey of Prison Inmates Data Analysis Tool (SPI DAT) from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. It's a dynamic tool that allows public access to interact with data visualizations, with custom charts for a range of characteristics of incarceratied individuals in 2016. 




## Results

## Summary


limitations to analysis: lack of longitudinal data following individuals due to HIPPA, lack of knowledge of true nature fo substance use (what drugs are used the most and to what extent)

## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the relationship between the likelihood of recidivism and the presence of substance use.  

## Milestone 2

My research question: How does the presence of substance use affect the likelihood of recidivism after incarceration?

Hypothesis: The presence of substance use increases the likelihood of recidivism due to the cyclical nature of addiction, isolation/difficulty reengaging with society, lack of rehabilitation treatment centers within jail/prison, and punitive nature of sentencing for drug-related crimes.

The percentage of the sample of who did not show a presence of substance use on release of incarceration had a smaller percentage of individuals who were rearrested within 36 months of release than the group who did show a presence of substance use on release of incarceration. It does not, however, indicate differences in gender or race/ethnicity. It also does not specify what the rearrest charge was or whether it resulted in a re-conviction or return to prison.

The data source, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections Primary Programs Report includes data on individuals who entered substance use treatment after their release from incarceration, specifically within the state. Notably, this does not necessarily mean that those with a drug offense entered these programs and it also does not include every person with a drug history, just those included in the study. 

The relationship shown above indicates that those who participated in the program experienced, on average, less rearrests than those with similar drug histories but who did not participate in treatment. The black line provides insight into how this group compares to the overall rearrest rate. The plot emphasizes again, that those experiencing substance use have relatively higher rearrest rates than the formerly incarcerated population as a whole . The periods where the treatment group showed a smaller rearrest rate than that of the total provides valuable insight into the potential of treatment in reducing overall recidivism. 

In regards to future research, the upwards progression over time of rearrests for all groups is valuable for identifying at which point treatment should be implemented when it is most effective post-release. There may be underlying mechanisms that accumulate over time and increasingly pull individuals toward criminogenic behavior. This puts into question the need for long-term, sustained interventions that emphasize smooth transition periods.
